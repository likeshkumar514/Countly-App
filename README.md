Countly App (Flutter + Firebase Auth + Riverpod)

A clean Flutter example you can ship: Firebase Email/Password authentication (signup, login, logout), Riverpod state management, and a modern animated Home screen with a counter.

Built for Android & iOS. This README gives everything a reviewer needs: features, architecture, setup, run, and troubleshooting.
